Please report bugs to the [issue tracker][issues]. Make sure to
include enough information to reproduce the issue, usually at least:
* the model and version of your Android TV media device
* the version of the Dreamcatcher app you're tried
* what you expected to happen
* what happened

## Asking questions

Open an issue in the [issue tracker][issues] with your question.

## Suggesting features

Add feature suggestions to the [issue tracker][issues] or better yet,
add the feature yourself and contribute to the project.

## Code contributions

To contribute code to the project, open a [pull request][pulls].

For larger features, it's a good idea to first open an 
[issue][issues] that describes the feature and mention that you're
thinking about working on it. This gives an opportunity to discuss the
new feature and its possible implementations.
